  Scenario Outline: Verify that next document in contents tree is opened in Read view on clicking 'Next document' button in Utility bar
    * I am logged in
    # Open <docId> document
    * I open "<docId>" document
    * "Contents Tab > #1 of Collapsed Parent Node > Header" should be visible
    # Remember text of "Selected Link" as "docTitle1"
    * I remember text of "Contents Tab > Selected Link" as "docTitle1"
    # Verify that doc's title displayed in Read view contains "{$docTitle1}" ("Selected Link" text)
    * Text of "Document Frame > Title" should contain "$docTitle1" ignoring case ignoring whitespaces
    # Verify that the following the next node after "Selected Link" in "Contents" panel is collapsed
    * "Contents Tab > #1 of Expanded Third Child Node" should not be visible
    # Click on "Next Document" button in Toolbar
    * I click "Toolbar > Next Document Button"
    * I wait until "Loading Indicator" is gone
    # Verify that the node after initially selected link in "Contents" panel is expanded and First of its documents is displayed Selected
    * Text of "Contents Tab > Selected Link" should not be "$docTitle1"
    # Remember text of currently "Selected Link" in "Contents" panel as "docTitle2"

    # Verify that document's title displayed in Read view contain remembered "{$docTitle2}"
    * Text of "Document Frame > Title" should contain "$docTitle2" ignoring case ignoring whitespaces
    # Check that text of "{$docTitle1}" and "{$docTitle2}" are different
    * "$docTitle1" text should not be equal to "$docTitle2" text
